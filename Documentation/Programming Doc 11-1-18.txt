Topic: Prelimenery writing of drive functions.

Pseudocode:
	void TURN(angle to turn to) {
	if(CURRENT_ANGLE < TURN_ANGLE (array value)){
	Run the left motors at a higher veloctiy
	Run the right motors at opposing but equal velocity
	//WEST COAST DRIVE ABILITY
	} else if(CURRENT_ANGLE > TURN_ANGLE) {
	Use the same scheme
}
}
	void DISTANCE(CURRENT_SET_DISTANCE) {
	TARGET_DISTANCE = CURRENT_SET_DISTANCE;
	insert the drive straight according to xa distance loop

}

Test Results:

Misc: May require us to switch to a time based control system.
	But since it's parameter based, time may not be an important factor.
	Check variable declaration and init.
